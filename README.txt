note: 	please use the server code here to run the game. Otherwise it will not work.
	I changed the server code a little, to make the program run
	If you have time find the bug and fix it.

@to do

1. Implement the "Graphic Controler Component" (High priority)

     * Easy to implemet
     * Just access the 2D array by calling "WarField.getField()" method
     * access the Location objects of the 2D Array and render the graphic according to the types of locations using XNA framework

2. Implement the "GUI" (Low priority)
     * Implement GUI features like a button for start the game, end the game, Highscore, Player statistic
